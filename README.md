<h2>Welcome to Coffee land</h2>
I am a driven Software Engineer and a dedicated Computer Science currently enrolled in the 2nd year of my Master of Science of Master in Computer Science and Modeling of Complex Systems at the HASSAN I University, Faculty of Science and Technology of Settat.

I’ve honed my skills during a valuable internship at Cloud Art, mastering cloud computing, automation, and version control. I’ve demonstrated dedication to both technical and non-technical aspects of technology. My solid educational foundation in computer science, coupled with a track record of community engagement, positions me to have a significant impact in the tech industry.
